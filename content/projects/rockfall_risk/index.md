The goal of this project is to assess the risk of fatalities caused by rockfalls on a section of the cantonal road below Schiers (GR), 
where outdated rockfall nets may no longer provide sufficient protection. 
Using available data on rockfall events, a Monte Carlo simulation will be implemented to calculate the probability 
of fatalities and provide recommendations to the local engineering authority on whether the road can remain open.
