---
This project aims to develop a solid understanding of numerical approximation methods in higher dimensions, 
with a particular focus on the gradient descent algorithm and its practical application in training neural networks. 
The project involves the implementation of a neural network from scratch, 
utilizing Python's built-in packages and a limited set of external libraries.
