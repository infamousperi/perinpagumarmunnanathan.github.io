title: "VTA Fourier Transformation"
date: 2024-06-09
type: "project"
---
This project aims to develop a foundational understanding of the Fourier Transformation 
for approximating periodic functions and its practical applications in data analysis.
By completing a series of tasks using Python and numerical methods, you will analyze various types of data, 
including sunspot records, audio signals, and images, using Fourier analysis techniques. 
The project emphasizes mathematical accuracy, clear communication, and reproducibility of results.
