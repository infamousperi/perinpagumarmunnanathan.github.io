The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listings in New York and identify the most expensive ones, 
using data visualization techniques. The data for the analysis was sourced from Kaggle, 
and the project leverages R programming libraries like Leaflet and Plotly for interactive visualizations. 
The project aims to provide insights into where the most expensive Airbnbs are located 
and to explore trends related to pricing across various neighborhoods.
