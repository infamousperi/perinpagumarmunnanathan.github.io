Completing the CareerSmart skills audit was a valuable experience that gave me insight into key areas for personal development.
Four main areas emerged as needing improvement: Communication, Numerical Skills, Managing Self, and Managing Others. 
Communication stood out, especially around delivering presentations and handling interpersonal conflict, skills that are crucial in both professional and personal settings. 
My numerical skills, particularly interpreting graphs and making calculations, need attention too.

Managing time and stress effectively is another challenge. 
Improving these areas will be essential for enhancing productivity and overall well-being. 
Leadership is also an area of focus; I aim to build stronger team management and performance oversight skills.

This audit has provided a clear pathway for growth, and I’m excited to explore courses, resources, and strategies to help me develop these competencies further. 
It’s a reminder that continuous self-assessment is key to career progress and personal satisfaction.
